# Cybersecurity Learning Progress – Kali & Networking

## Purpose
This repository documents what I have practiced so far in Kali Linux and networking, and my learning path toward cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and blue-team concepts.

---

## What I Have Done So Far

### 1. Networking Basics
- Practiced connectivity testing using:
  - ping
  - traceroute
  - ip a
  - ip route
- Understood the difference between:
  - reachability testing (ICMP – ping)
  - service discovery (TCP/UDP – nmap)

### 2. Nmap Scanning Practice
- Performed scans on different targets such as:
  - google.com
  - 8.8.8.8
- Used commands:
  - nmap google.com
  - nmap -sV google.com
  - nmap -T3 google.com
- Observed that:
  - google.com shows ports like 80/tcp and 443/tcp because it is a web server
  - DNS servers behave differently from web servers
  - nmap reveals services while ping only checks if host is alive

### 3. Kali Linux Hands-On
- Basic Linux commands for navigation and analysis  
- Reading terminal outputs and logs  
- Writing simple bash scripts for host discovery  
- Troubleshooting network issues inside Kali

### 4. Security Concepts Started
- Learning the difference between:
  - CVE – real vulnerability instance  
  - CWE – category of weakness
- Introduction to:
  - MITRE ATT&CK and TTPs  
  - Defensive mindset (MITRE D3FEND)

---

## What I Learned

- Ping = “Is the system alive?”
- Nmap = “What services are running on that system?”
- Different targets expose different ports based on their role  
- Timing options like -T3 affect scan behavior  
- Cybersecurity requires understanding, not just running tools

---

## What I Am Going to Learn Next

- MISP platform for threat intelligence sharing  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping of real attacks  
- MITRE D3FEND defensive techniques  
- Deeper Nmap scanning and log analysis  
- SOC workflow and vulnerability analysis

---

## Goal

To become capable of:
- Understanding attacks through ATT&CK  
- Thinking like a defender using D3FEND  
- Contributing to threat intelligence and analysis tasks  
- Working effectively in a cybersecurity project environment
